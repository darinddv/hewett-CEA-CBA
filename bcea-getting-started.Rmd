```{r}
library(BCEA)
library(ggplot2)
```

Load the data.
```{r}
data(Smoking)
```

This study has four interventions.
```{r}
treats <- c("No intervention", "Self-help", "Individual counselling", "Group counselling")
```

Setting the reference group (ref) to Group counselling and the maximum willingness to pay (Kmax) as 500
```{r}
bcea_smoke <- bcea(eff, cost, ref = 4, interventions = treats, Kmax = 500)
```

We can easily create a grid of the most common plots
```{r}
dev.new(width=20, height=20, unit="in")
plot(bcea_smoke)
```


Individual plots can be plotting using their own functions.
```{r}
ceplane.plot(bcea_smoke, comparison = 2, wtp = 250)
eib.plot(bcea_smoke)
```
```{r}
contour(bcea_smoke)
```

```{r}
ceac.plot(bcea_smoke)
```

```{r}
ib.plot(bcea_smoke)
```
